## Final Year Project
**Topic : Singing Video Generation with Music Separation**

### Summary

“Singing Video Generation with Music Separation” was our project topic that aims to develop an advanced model that is able to
generate high quality human singing face videos with lively face expression and head movement with the provided music. 
This was a focus of research on developing a talking face generation due to the demand of realistic virtual avatars and interactive 
interfaces especially inside the entertainment industry. So, the objective of this project is to continue the research
on finding and proposing a valid solution to solve the problem of generating human talking
face video.

These are the specific aims of the project which includes:
- Perform an in-depth research on developing a model
- Brainstorm various approaches to tackle problems that are caused by the generation,
such as lip synchronization, head movement and emotion expression.
- Create a robust application for improvise human talking face generation based on the
solution proposed
